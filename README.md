# Automation

## Exploring Human Decision Making

Automation is sometimes seen as replacing humans.  However, in most cases only some elements of tasks performed by humans is replaced.

For example, an autopilot does not replace human pilots in an airplane. It merely makes the task of flying easier for human pilots, still requiring vigilent supervision of potential failure modes of automation. For many more years, this state of partial automation will remain in safety critical tasks.   

Situation is not very different in deremining and adminstering medication to a patient. Whether it is determining insulin dose, or chemotherapy dose,
humans are still involved in the critical decisions, often aided by computers and software.

Therefore, human decision making process under partial automation needs to be examined closely.  In addition, understanding the process of human decision making is important even for human behavior not involving automation per se.  

Here we will explore this topic using Jupyter notebooks and Python for live interaction with the user.
