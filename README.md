# Automation
Exploring Human Decision Making

Automation is sometimes seen as replacing humans.  However, in most cases only some elements of tasks performed by humans is replaced.

For example, an autopilot does not replace human pilots in an airplane-it merely helps the taks of flying easier for human pilots. 
For many more years, this state of partial automation will remain in safety critical tasks, including self-driving cars. 

Situation is not very different in deremining and adminstering medication to a patient. Whether it is determining insulin dose, or cancer medication,
humans are still involved in the critical decisions, often aided by computers and software.
